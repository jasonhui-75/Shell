# Shell
Implemented my own shell with a few basic functions using C. 
This will contain a makefile that will compile the c file into an object file named shell.o

Commands/features implemented
Simple commands: ls, cd, pwd
History: type !! to execute the last command
Redirection: user can direct input and output with > and <
Pipe:| is also implemented to allow even more freedom with output and input
